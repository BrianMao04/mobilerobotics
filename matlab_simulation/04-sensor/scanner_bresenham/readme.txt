-An example of using inverse measurement model to scan and create a occupancy grid map is presented in the example.m.

-In the example.m, various functions will be called and most of them are in the 04-sensor folder, only one called "creat_a_map.m" is in   the 10-environment folder.

-Robot will keep spinning and scanning while moving inside the real map. It will bounce back once it collide with walls or obstables.

-The "creat_a_map.m" function generates a map with some random-scale obstacles, and this function may probabbly used by others.
